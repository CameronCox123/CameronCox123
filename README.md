## Heyo, I'm Cameron

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in robotics, music, and chess

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m actively working on creating an autonomous battle bot that can be replicated by freshman for the upcoming fall semester

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and everything circuits. I've taken courses on computing, software design, and plenty of calculus

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about computer repair! PC randomly crashing? CPU heatsink whining too loud? I've been repairing PCs and peripheral devices since I was twelve so I've got a good sum of knowledge built up

âš¡ Fun fact: I replaced my keyboard keys with clear, unmarked keys. It was weird at first but now I can touch-type numbers so that's cool
